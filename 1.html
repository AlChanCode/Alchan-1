<span>How are different forms</span> of the same word counted?<br>
All wordlists arelemmatized (=different forms of the same words are counted together, i.e. goes, went, gone, going and go are counted together and listed as go). This is generally more practical. However, sometimes non-lemmatized word lists listing each word form separately are needed. Sketch Engine can generate both types of word lists.
